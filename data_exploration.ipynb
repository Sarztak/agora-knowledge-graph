         "\nHUMAN ALTERNATIVES, CONSIDERATION, AND FALLBACK\nYou should be able to opt out, where appropriate, and have access to a person who can quickly consider and remedy problems you encounter. You should be able to opt out from automated systems in favor of a human alternative, where appropriate. Appropriateness should be determined based on reasonable expectations in a given context and with a focus on ensuring broad accessibility and protecting the public from especially harmful impacts. In some cases, a human or other alternative may be required by law. You should have access to timely human consideration and remedy by a fallback and escalation process if an automated system fails, it produces an error, or you would like to appeal or contest its impacts on you. Human consideration and fallback should be accessible, equitable, effective, maintained, accompanied by appropriate operator training, and should not impose an unreasonable burden on the public. Automated systems with an intended use within sensitive domains, including, but not limited to, criminal justice, employment, education, and health, should additionally be tailored to the purpose, provide meaningful access for oversight, include training for any people interacting with the system, and incorporate human consideration for adverse or high-risk decisions. Reporting that includes a description of these human governance processes and assessment of their timeliness, accessibility, outcomes, and effectiveness should be made public whenever possible. \nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT\nThere are many reasons people may prefer not to use an automated system: the system can be flawed and can lead to unintended outcomes; it may reinforce bias or be inaccessible; it may simply be inconvenient or unavailable; or it may replace a paper or manual process to which people had grown accustomed. Yet members of the public are often presented with no alternative, or are forced to endure a cumbersome process to reach a human decision-maker once they decide they no longer want to deal exclusively with the automated system or be impacted by its results. As a result of this lack of human reconsideration, many receive delayed access, or lose access, to rights, opportunities, benefits, and critical services. The American public deserves the assurance that, when rights, opportunities, or access are meaningfully at stake and there is a reasonable expectation of an alternative to an automated system, they can conveniently opt out of an automated system and will not be disadvantaged for that choice. In some cases, such a human or other alternative may be required by law, for example it could be required as \"reasonable accommodations\" for people with disabilities. \nIn addition to being able to opt out and use a human alternative, the American public deserves a human fallback system in the event that an automated system fails or causes harm. No matter how rigorously an automated system is tested, there will always be situations for which the system fails. The American public deserves protection via human review against these outlying or unexpected scenarios. In the case of time-critical systems, the public should not have to wait-immediate human consideration and fallback should be available. In many time-critical systems, such a remedy is already immediately available, such as a building manager who can open a door in the case an automated card access system fails. \nIn the criminal justice system, employment, education, healthcare, and other sensitive domains, automated systems are used for many purposes, from pre-trial risk assessments and parole decisions to technologies that help doctors diagnose disease. Absent appropriate safeguards, these technologies can lead to unfair, inaccurate, or dangerous outcomes. These sensitive domains require extra protections. It is critically important that there is extensive human oversight in such settings. \nThese critical protections have been adopted in some scenarios. Where automated systems have been introduced to provide the public access to government benefits, existing human paper and phone-based processes are generally still in place, providing an important alternative to ensure access. Companies that have introduced automated call centers often retain the option of dialing zero to reach an operator. When automated identity controls are in place to board an airplane or enter the country, there is a person supervising the systems who can be turned to for help or to appeal a misidentification. \nThe American people deserve the reassurance that such procedures are in place to protect their rights, opportunities, and access. People make mistakes, and a human alternative or fallback mechanism will not always have the right answer, but they serve as an important check on the power and validity of automated systems. \n- An automated signature matching system is used as part of the voting process in many parts of the country to determine whether the signature on a mail-in ballot matches the signature on file. These signature matching systems are less likely to work correctly for some voters, including voters with mental or physical disabilities, voters with shorter or hyphenated names, and voters who have changed their name.97 A human curing process,98 which helps voters to confirm their signatures and correct other voting mistakes, is important to ensure all votes are counted,99 and it is already standard practice in much of the country for both an election official and the voter to have the opportunity to review and correct any such issues.100 \n- An unemployment benefits system in Colorado required, as a condition of accessing benefits, that applicants have a smartphone in order to verify their identity. No alternative human option was readily available, which denied many people access to benefits.101\n- A fraud detection system for unemployment insurance distribution incorrectly flagged entries as fraudulent, leading to people with slight discrepancies or complexities in their files having their wages withheld and tax returns seized without any chance to explain themselves or receive a review by a person.102\n- A patient was wrongly denied access to pain medication when the hospital's software confused her medication history with that of her dog's. Even after she tracked down an explanation for the problem, doctors were afraid to override the system, and she was forced to go without pain relief due to the system's error.103\n- A large corporation automated performance evaluation and other HR functions, leading to workers being fired by an automated system without the possibility of human review, appeal or other form of recourse.104  \n",
