Prompt for Named Entity Label Discovery (NER Phase 2: Entity Type Design)
________________________________________
DATASET CONTEXT: You are working with a corpus of U.S. and international regulatory documents related to artificial intelligence (AI) governance. These documents include legislation, executive directives, agency mandates, strategic initiatives, risk frameworks, technical standards, and oversight procedures. In Phase 1, named entities were extracted from these documents without any type labels. You are now in Phase 2, where the goal is to design and define a practical, data-driven label schema for use in knowledge graph construction.
This phase is not about tagging entities with existing labels, but about discovering and clustering the label categories themselves based on the entities extracted.
________________________________________
GOAL: Given a list of raw named entities (with their sentences), group them by conceptual similarity and assign each group a short, meaningful label name that represents the type of entity.
This becomes the first version of your named entity label taxonomy.
________________________________________
STEP 1: READ THE ENTITIES Examine each extracted entity in the context of its sentence. Think about: - What kind of “thing” is it? - Does it represent a role, organization, system, law, program, etc.? - Would similar entities from other documents fit in the same category?
________________________________________
STEP 2: GROUP SIMILAR ENTITIES Group all entities into meaningful conceptual categories. Each entity must be assigned to exactly one group. Avoid overly narrow or overly broad categories.
________________________________________
STEP 3: ASSIGN LABEL NAMES TO GROUPS Label each group with a short, UPPERCASE tag (e.g., ORG, LAW, TECH, PROGRAM, DOC, REQUIREMENT). Use label names that could scale well across hundreds of documents.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return the output as a JSON object structured like this:
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "category_name": "ORG",
      "entities": [
        "Department of the Navy",
        "Treasury Department",
        "Office of Management and Budget"
      ]
    },
    {
      "category_name": "PROGRAM",
      "entities": [
        "Federal AI scholarship-for-service program",
        "Digital On-Demand Program"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

EXAMPLES OF POSSIBLE LABELS
Label	Example Entities
ORG	Department of Energy, FCC, European Commission
ROLE	Secretary of the Navy, Director of NIST
LAW	Executive Order 14110, America COMPETES Act
PROGRAM	AI scholarship-for-service program, Frontier AI Framework
TECH	machine learning, predictive maintenance technologies
DATA	Federal AI System Inventory, weather forecasting datasets
DOC	annual report, strategy, evaluation
REQUIREMENT	auditability, duty of care, informed consent
FUNDING	appropriations, grants, fiscal terms
PLACE	U.S., California, European Union
Only include a label if you have seen multiple entities that justify the category.
•	Don’t include a label like FUNDING if you haven’t yet seen enough entities (e.g. “appropriations”, “grants”) that justify grouping them under that.
•	This helps avoid prematurely defining empty or theoretical categories that don’t reflect your actual data.

________________________________________
STEP 4: GUIDELINES - Labels must be mutually exclusive and clearly defined - Every entity must be assigned to a group — no leftovers - Do not group based on syntax alone — group based on semantic role - The final label list will drive downstream NER annotation
________________________________________
USAGE NOTES: - This phase defines your ontology. - Later phases will use these labels to tag all entities in the corpus. - You may refine labels as you see patterns or edge cases emerge.
Let this be conceptual, not overly rigid — it’s meant to help you operationalize structured extraction over a large corpus.
